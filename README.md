# Visualization
A program using sigma.js to combine and display two (maybe more) DFA's visually


Checkout the Viz folder at the top of the repo.
Inside the folder are three files:
  combine.py
  VisIndex.html
  data
  
Inside the data folder are three files:
  dfaExample1.json
  dfaExample2.json
  combined.json
  
When you run combine.py, it will combine the contents of dfaExample1 and 2 into combined.json
VisIndex.html will render combined.json and display it to the screen
This is the most basic implementation possible (probably)

Before this happens you MUST enter the command 'npm start' inside the sigma.js directory. How you do this is up to you. I have been 
researching methods to make this whole process into an executable of some sort
